Welcome to my Login Form !!!

This is a simple login form that I made in React for usage in future projects.
I used a simple validation for the password input and after the login I remove 
the input form and I show the user an element that allows a logout.

I made use of React Context to use the same state in different components.

Check out the custom favicon *wink *wink

Here you can see my project in action: https://login-form-application.netlify.app/

Hope you enjoy !!!
